Git is a distributed version control system. So, What is a Version Control System?
A version Control system is a system that maintains different versions of your project when we work in a team or as an individual. (system managing changes to files) As the project progresses, new features get added to it. So,
a version control system maintains all your different versions of your project for you and you can rollback to any version you want without causing any trouble to you for maintaining different versions by giving names to it like MyProject, MyProjectWithFeature1, etc.


Distributed Version control system means every collaborator(any developer working on a team project)has a local repository of the project in his/her local machine unlike central where team members should have an internet connection to every time update their work to the main central repository.
